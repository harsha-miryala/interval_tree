The implementation of interval trees is done with the help of BST

Input format:<br />
n - no.of nodes to be added<br />
x[1] y[1] - interval 1 <br />
x[2] y[2] - interval 2

  .    .<br />
  .	   .<br />
  .    .<br />
  .    .<br />
  .    .<br />
x[n] y[n] - interval n<br />
q - no.of queries to be done<br />
x[1] y[1] - interval 1 <br />
x[2] y[2] - interval 2 

  .    .<br />
  .	   .<br />
  .    .<br />
  .    .<br />
  .    .<br />
x[q] y[q] - interval q<br /> 
d - no.of intervals to be deleted<br />
x[1] y[1] - interval 1 <br />
x[2] y[2] - interval 2 

  .    .<br />
  .	   .<br />
  .    .<br />
  .    .<br />
  .    .<br />
x[d] y[d] - interval d<br />

In the query operation for searching overlapping interval,<br />
only one interval which is first available is printed .

The impementation can also be done using Red black trees or AVL trees
